AI-Powered Travel Itinerary Generator



**Project Description**

This is an AI-enhanced web application designed to generate personalized travel itineraries. The application uses a Streamlit front-end to collect user inputs, including a destination, interests, budget, and trip duration. It then leverages a public API to gather real-time weather data for the selected location and a generative AI model (Google's Gemini) to create a detailed, custom itinerary.



The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate the integration of external data collection and generative AI within a functional, interactive web application.
